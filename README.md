# MCCProject

This repository was created for a project within my Mobile Cloud Computing course within my Master's at Brock University with a fellow student.  Once completed, it was made public.  More development is planned as time permits.

The src folder has the Java files as well as the Octave file.
The project folder has this file and the report submitted alongside this code for the class.  The report will not be updated.
