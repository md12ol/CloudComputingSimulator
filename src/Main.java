 * This class was created to handle the simulation of a Mobile Cloud Computing architecture which
 * includes a single mobile device, a single mobile access point, and a single remote cloud server.
 * The purpose to simulate this architecture is to test whether the inclusion of computation
 * resources at the access point, which can process tasks from the mobile device, has better
 * performance than a cloud computing system with only the remote cloud for execution.
